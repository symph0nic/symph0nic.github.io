# .edu Community Mentoring Program at Defcon 33

This year at def con we are building a new community space around education. Part of our mission is to help those in education support and defend their institutions, and help those in education choose their career path, so we are creating a new mentorship program.

This is where you come in.

We are opening today a call for both mentors & mentees, who will have an introductory meeting during def con.

## Mentors: 
We are looking for volunteers working in the cybersecurity industry, with at least 5 years of experience, who would like to spare a little time over the coming months to support motivated mentees in their growth journey.

## Mentees: 
Are you aged 18 or over, in education and looking to find your first role in cybersecurity? Are you in your first role and trying to figure out what's next? Then this program is for you.

## Requirements:
Time commitment: We would ideally like these to be long term mentoring relationships. However, we know that people are busy so we propose the following minimum commitment:
- Be available to meet between mentor and mentee at def con - we'll set up a 'mixer' event for this during the con
- Be prepared to have roughly monthly calls between you both for the following 6 months
- Be motivated (mentee) and willing to help (mentor)

## Sign-up:

### Thank you for your support of the future of cybersecurity!
